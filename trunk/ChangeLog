	* Edited the file corset.cc, Transcript.h, Transcript.cc and Cluster.cc. A bug was identified in the get_dist() function in Cluster.cc, where the ngroups variable was being incorrectly set. Older versions of the code will still run if the groups list is sorted e.g. "1,1,2,2,3,3" but not for orders such as "1,2,3,3,2,1".
	* Incrementing to version 0.92
