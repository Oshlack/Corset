Requirements
------------
Corset requires samtools to be installed. Specifically it will use the 
library files and headers, so these must be in a place that can be 
accessed by Corset.

We also suggest using gcc version 4.3 or greater because some newer 
container classes are available in c++0x. This is not a requirement 
however, code compiled with an older version of gcc will run slower.


Installation
------------
Compile and install in the usual way with:

./configure
make
make install

Note that when running configure you may need to specify the 
locations of sam.h and libbam with: 
--with-bam_inc=<path_to_sam.h> and --with-bam_lib=<path_to_bam_library>


Running
-------
Type "corset" to get usage information.
