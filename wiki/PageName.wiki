= Usage =

Usage: corset [options] <input bam file1> <input bam file2> etc .....
options are:

	 -d 	 A comma seperated list of distance thresholds. The range must
	    	 be between 0 and 1. e.g -d 0.4,0.5, default: 0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9

	 -D 	 The value used for thresholding the log likelihood ratio. The default
	    	 value will depend on the number of degrees of freedom (which is 1 - the
	    	 number of groups). By default D = 17.5 + 2.5 * ndf, which corresponds
	    	 approximately to a p-value threshold of 10^-5, when there are fewer than
	    	 10 groups.

	 -m 	 Filter out any transcripts with fewer than this many reads aligning. Default: 10

	 -g 	 Specifies the grouping. ie. which samples belong to which experimental
	    	 groups. The parameter must be a comma separated line (no spaces), with the
	    	 groupings given in the same order as the sample filename. For example:
	    	 -g Group1,Group1,Group2,Group2 etc. If this option is not used, each sample
	    	 is treated as an independent experimental group.

	 -p 	 Prefix for the output filenames. The output files will be of the form
	    	 <prefix>-counts-<distance>.txt and <prefix>-clusters-<distance>.txt,
	    	 default filenames are counts-<distance>.txt and clusters-<distance>.txt

	 -f 	 Specifies whether outputfile should be overwritten if they already exist.
	    	 Maybe true or false, default: false

	 -n 	 Specifies the sample names to be used in the header of the output count files.
	    	 This should be a comma seperated list without spaces.
	    	 e.g. -n Group1-ReplicateA,Group1-ReplicateB,Group2-ReplicateA etc.
	    	 default: the input filenames will be used.
